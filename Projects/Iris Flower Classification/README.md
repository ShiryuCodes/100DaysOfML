# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning classification task using the classic [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset). The objective is to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.
