# Linear Regression from Scratch

This is an intermediate-level machine learning project where I implemented **Linear Regression from scratch** using NumPy and Python.

The goal of this project was to understand the inner workings of linear regression and how gradient descent is used to minimize the loss function and update the weights and bias.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

* Created a custom `LinearRegression` class
* Manually implemented gradient descent
* Trained the model on synthetic data
* Visualized predictions vs actual data using `matplotlib`

## ðŸ“š Libraries Used

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib.pyplot`

## ðŸ“ˆ Skills Practiced

* Mathematical understanding of linear regression
* Gradient descent from scratch
* Python OOP and matrix operations with NumPy
* Data visualization

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

* Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
* Weight and bias updates using gradients
* Linear relationship modeling

## âœ… Output

A regression line was fitted to the training data and plotted along with the original data points to visually assess performance.
