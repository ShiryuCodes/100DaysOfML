# ðŸ§  100DaysOfML

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfML** challenge! ðŸš€  
This repository documents my daily progress as I learn, build, and experiment with Machine Learning â€” one day at a time.

## ðŸ“… What is #100DaysOfML?

**#100DaysOfML** is a self-imposed commitment to dedicate time every day for 100 days to learning and practicing **Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science**. The idea is to build consistency, reinforce core concepts, and work on practical projects.
